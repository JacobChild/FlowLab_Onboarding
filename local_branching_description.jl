    It looks like when I create a new branch (test_branch) in Atom, it
    changes my local files to just the branch files, not the main files.
    This means I "lose" the main files locally, but they are all online?
    Update: whichever branch I hvae selected in Atom, is the one who's files
        I can see and edit. I think I do have to hit fetch though
