*Figure 1: A Plot of the NACA 2412 Airfoil. Generated using Cosine spacing and 20 points on both the top and bottom (for the source code see [Here](https://github.com/JacobChild/FlowLab_Onboarding/blob/9f6389461f356a878bb87c64cd1cda8c4b8043e0/AirFoilCoordinatesArraysActivity.jl))*



### NACA 2412 Polar Plots Under Various Conditions

**Note:** As smoothing a polar plot requires extensive user input and trial and error, only the first plot/case will be extended and smoothed, the rest will simply be given as is.



**M = 0, Re = 10,000, Ncrit = 7**

*Figure 2: Plot under the given conditions (M = 0, Re = 10,000, Ncrit = 7) at different angles of attack given in degrees (Originally -1 to 10 deg before extending). All the plots were smoothed, and the Cm and Cl plots were extended and smoothed from -pi to pi. For methods, see the source code linked in the appendix.*
